God, the documentation for `?table` is so jargon-y. I think table counts the number of factors, or unique elements, in its argument. Apparently this is called a _contingency table_.

* In the first output, table tells us there are 91 "female" entries and 92 "male" entries, as we constructed directly above.

* In the 2nd output, we have re-defined gender by explicitly specifying its factors as "male" and "female". Since these were already the factors, all this did was change the order in which the items are reported.

* In the third output, we have done the same as in the second, but misspelled "male" as "Male". When table tries to count "Males", it finds none, so it tells us there are 0 entries of "Male" and 91 of "female".

* In the last table entry, it would seem exclude = NULL is telling the function not to exclude anything from the table summary. The description in the documentation is garbage, so this is just empirical.

1. Plot 1 is just a regular plot of the data. It does a poor job showing any relationships because of the large range in values present.
2. Plot 2 has tried to condense the data ranges with `sqrt`. This does condense the data, but still doesn't show the small numbers well.
3. Plot 3 raises the data to the 0.1 power, which does a much nicer job at showing scaling across many orders of magnitudes. However, this will only appear linear for data that has a scaling relationship of $y = x^{10}$. 
4. This takes the log of the data, an astronomer's favorite! It makes all power relationships appear linear, where the slope of the line through the data is the exponent of the power relationship (e.g. $y = x^5$ implies data on a log log plot will have a slope of 5.)

I don't think so. I mean, they all seem to have different distributions.

This seems to do it. There's probably a cleaner way...
